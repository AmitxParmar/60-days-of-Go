Heavily inspired by the awesome [go-dockerclient/testing](https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/tree/master/testing) I started a new lib called [Godo testing](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/godo-testing).

In summary is a package that fakes the api of digital ocean, and makes the tests using your [client](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo) easier.
