FizzBuzz

In this problem, you should display a list from 1 to 100, one on each line, with
with the following exceptions:
Numbers divisible by 3 should appear as 'Fizz' instead of number;
Numbers divisible by 5 should appear as 'Buzz' instead of number;
Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 should appear as 'FizzBuzz' instead of number;
